I am currently in my penultimate year of studies at the National University of Singapore. I am pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.

My specialisations include Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence, and I have a huge penchant for entrepreneurship.

Beyond my specialisations, I especially love Frontend Engineering and Design. In my opinion, aesthetic visuals are one of the quintessential components of any successful idea. I want to be the implementer and creator of modern interfaces.
